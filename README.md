## What am I doing at Dal?
I am a ***Third-year Neuroscience 🧠*** student and I want to attempt to get a certificate in ***Neurotechnology Innovation💡***

## Why am I doing what I am doing?
After highschool I went to ***UBC*** to do *Nutritional Sciences* but soon realised that I did'nt enjoy it 😔
I then transfered to ***Dalhousie University*** last fall, since I knew that *Psychology and Neuroscience* was of my intrest! 

## How did I gain intrest in Neuroscience and Psychology? 
I first got intrested in psychology during my IB Psych course, where I had an **amazing professor** who really sparked my curiosity and helped me strive. Additionally I have alwyas enjoyed biology, so the idea of *blending* it with psychology felt natural!
