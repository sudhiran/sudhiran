## What am I doing at Dal?
I am a ***Third-year Neuroscience 🧠*** student and I want to attempt to get a certificate in ***Neurotechnology Innovation💡***

## Why am I doing what I am doing?
After highschool I went to ***UBC*** to do *Nutritional Sciences* but soon realised that I didn't enjoy it 😔
I then transfered to ***Dalhousie University*** last fall, since I knew that *Psychology and Neuroscience* was of my intrest! 

## How did I gain intrest in Neuroscience and Psychology? 
I first got intrested in psychology during my **IB Psych course**, where I had an amazing professor who really sparked my curiosity🧐 and helped me strive. Additionally I have alwyas enjoyed biology🧬, so the idea of **blending** it with psychology felt natural! 

## What are my career plans?
When I began uni, I would've become anything but a doctor cause the idea of handing losses scared me🫣. But now, **I want nothing else than to go to med school!** How the tables have turned!!
